# Obscura

## Project Overview

Obscura is a high-performance Middleware Proxy designed to solve the “Privacy Paradox” in enterprise AI. As companies integrate RAG, they risk leaking Personally Identifiable Information (PII) to external LLM providers, a liability costing an average of $4.45 million per breach. Obscura sits between the internal application and the cloud, utilizing BERT-based Named Entity Recognition (NER) to mask sensitive data in real-time

By deploying as a Kubernetes Sidecar on Oracle Cloud Infrastructure, Obscura provides an automated security layer that is “invisible” to developers, ensuring that sensitive data never leaves the secure perimeter.

## Project Scope:

### Must-Haves:

- Rust-based Proxy Core for low-latency traffic interception
- BERT-NER Integration for real-time PII/PHI detection
- Cloud-Native Deployment on OCI Managed Kubernetes (OKE)
- Reversible Masking logic to restore data for authorized users

### Stretch Goals:

- Differential Privacy injection to prevent “Membership Inference Attacks”
- Grafana Dashboard for real-time cloud telemetry and “Headless” insights
- Multi-model Support (switching between Gemini, OpenAI, and Llama)

### Project Objectives & Success Metrics:

- Achieve sub-60ms overhead for the total proxy-round trip to ensure little disruption to developer workflows
- Attain 90%+ accuracy in PII detection across standard datasets (Names, SSNs, Emails) using the BERT model
- Successful E2E deployment on OCI with an automated GitHub Actions CI/CD pipeline

## UI Design:

### Platform: Headless Cloud-Native Middleware. Instead of building a traditional frontend website, which introduces security risks and development “bloat,” Obscura utilizes an Observability-as-a-UI strategy.

- **Platform**: Web-based Cloud Dashboard via Grafana Cloud
- **Key “Screens”:**
    - **Telemetry Dashboard:** Real-time visualization of proxy traffic, latency metrics, and redaction throughput
    - **Security Insight Panel:** High-level summary of the “vulnerability” density and PII types detected (e.g., 45 names redacted, 12 SSNs blocked)
- **User Interactions:**
    - **Configuration YAMLs:** Developers interact with the proxy by updating the environment variables or YAML configs in the Kubernetes cluster
    - **Alerting Rules:** Automated alerts via email or Jira when a “high-risk” data flow (e.g., raw PHI) is detected

## Backend & APIs:

- **Architecture:** Multi-threaded, asynchronous Rust proxy server
- **API Structure:**
    - **Transparent Proxy API**: A REST-compatible endpoint that mirrors external LLM providers (e.g., OpenAI or Gemini)
    - **Health Check Endpoint:** An internal API for Kubernetes to monitor the “liveness” and “readiness” of the proxy
- **Authentication & Privacy:**
    - **Credential Passthrough:** Obscura passes existing Auth headers (JWT/OAuth) to the target LLM after verifying the local secure tunnel
    - **In-Memory Processing:** No sensitive data is stored on disk; all PII is redacted in-memory using NER

## Data & AI Model

- **Model Architecture:** BERT-based NER
- **Functionality:**
    - **Semantic Labeling:** The model classifies spans of text as “Person,” “Organization,” “Location,” “Healthcare Data.”
    - **Presidio-style Anonymization:** A hybrid logic layer that applies deterministic rules (like Regex for SSNs) alongside the transformer model’s semantic predictions
- **Data Sources:**
    - **HuggingFace / Presidio Datasets:** Pre-trained on large-scale PII datasets for initial accuracy
    - **Synthetic Medical Data:** For testing PHI-specific redaction without using actual patient records

## Tech Stack

- **Frontend (Insights):** Grafana Cloud / OCI Monitoring (No custom UI build)
- **Backend:** Rust (for safety and speed) and Go (for pipeline utilities)
- **Database:** Supabase (PostgreSQL) for logging anonymized telemtry
- **AI/ML:** BERT, TensorFlow, PyTorch (for NER engine), and scispaCy (for medical entity detection)
- **Cloud & Hosting:** Oracle Cloud Infrastructure (OCI) with Managed Kubernetes (OKE)

## Hardware & Software Requirements

- **Hardware:**
    - Local Development: Standard workstations with at least 16gb RAM for running local K8s clusters
    - Cloud: OCI Ampere A1 instances provided by the “Always Free” tier
- Software:
    - Rust Toolchain (Cargo)
    - Docker / Kubernetes (kubectl)
    - GitHub Actions for CI/CD automation
