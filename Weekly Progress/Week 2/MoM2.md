# Meeting Notes:

## To-Do:
- Refine project spec
- Finalize AI Tools(Done) -> No standard AI stack, using anything we have access to (ChatGPT, Gemini, Claude)
- Align AI tech stack across the team (above)
- Solidifying approach using AWS EC2 (kyle)

## Notes:
- Moving away from OCI bc limits the target audience (can only work alongside other OCI apps)
- Testing 4 different BERT models, establishing baseline F1 score -> Testing the smallest model first to see if viable (if viable, reduces latency and RAM)
- Establish a high-level architecture diagram for reference

## Status Report:
